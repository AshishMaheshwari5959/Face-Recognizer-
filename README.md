# Face Recognizer using Transfer Learning
In this project i have made a face recognizer using transfer learning concepts on CNN Architecture. 
I have used two architectures in my project one is VGG16 and other is MOBILENET.
I have experienced that MOBILENET is more accurate then VGG16.

# Project Description
I have basically divided my project into 3 parts

1) Dataset Creation : In this i have used Open-CV library and harcascade classifiers for detecting only face. Then after detecting face the program will click 1000 photos automatically which takes less than 5 min. Which resolves a create problem of creating dataset. ( The photos are to be saved in two places one is for training and other is for validation ).

2) MODEL TRAINING : In this i have used pre defined weights from two famous CNN architecture VGG16 and MOBILENET. After applying transfer learning Model training became very easy and feasible with respect to resources like RAM, CPU and TIME which is sometimes a big issue for company.

3) MODEL TESTING : After model training i have saved that files for further usage and that i have used in testing. Testing is simply a webcam based testing which is live in my case whomsoever comes in front of camera his name automatically prints up on the screen.

# Applications
1) Automation in Attendance system
2) Police Survelliance
3) Spying
4) Finding Lost People

# Improvements
Because of limited resources i cannot improve its accuracy to a satisfactory level.
